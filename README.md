# BatterWars
Batter Wars is a 2-D platformer themed around pancakes. The player plays as a pancake chef who must traverse a level filled with enemies made of pancake batter and chocolate chips.
# Controls

The player can be moved left and right with the A and D keys, and jump with the W key. The player shoots pancakes with the left mouse button.

# How To Play

The player must traverse a platforming level while avoiding or killing melee and ranged enemies. Chippy is the melee enemy, and he attacks the player by running into her. Globby is the ranged enemy, and he attacks by shooting batter bullets at the player.
At the end of the level, the player will encounter a boss enemy, which they must kill to win the game. The boss enemy attacks in three ways. Firstly, he slams either his left or right fist into the ground, damaging the player if she touches them. The second attack is triggered once in a while by the boss’s slam attack. This attack is called “Batter Rain”, and involves globs of batter falling from the sky from random positions within the boss fight area. The player must avoid the falling batter, or she will take damage. The final attack is a wave of batter which washes across the boss fight area. The player must jump over the wave to avoid taking damage.
In order to win, the player must take away all of the boss’s lives by dealing damage to him. The only way for the player to damage the boss is to attack his fists while he is performing a “Slam Attack”. If the player takes damage three times before killing the boss, the player loses.
